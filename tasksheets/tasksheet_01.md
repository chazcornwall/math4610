A version control system (VCS) is a system that records every change made to code base. These changes are usually recorded as "commits". Developers can then revert, or go back to a commit, if recent changes in the code do not work as intended. This type of system is also useful for recording who made the change. If there are any problems with a particular deployment, that problem can be traced to the changes and the individuals who are responsible for those changes. [See here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) and [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/version-control-systems/) for websites describing VCS.
