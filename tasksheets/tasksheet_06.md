**Task 1**

When I pick a value sufficiently close to zero and close to the root, newton's method and secant method find the root. The fixed point iteration method does not converge unless I make epsilon 0.1. The bisection method also converged to the correct root (closest to zero) if the bounds were evenly spaced about 0 (i.e. [-5,5]). Considering how the bisection algorithm works, this behavior is dependent on the specific function that was used and is not characteristic of the algorithm itself. 

**Task 2**

Setting x0 to -5 and 6 did not change the output of newton's method from that from Task 1.
