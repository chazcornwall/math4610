# Solutions for Tasksheet 9
[See here](https://github.com/jvkoebbe/math4610/blob/master/tasksheets/tasksheet_09/html/tasksheet_09.html) for problem set.

A test program was created to executed all of the tasks described in tasksheet 9. This test program can be found in the test directory [here](../test/task9/task9.cpp). Each task enumerated below will contain an image of a section of the test program's output. All the source code used to implement the Linear Algebra operations are found [here](../src/linsolver.cpp).

See [here](../software_manual/README.md) for documentation of important methods in the `LinearAlgebra::Matrix` class that were used in this tasksheet.
